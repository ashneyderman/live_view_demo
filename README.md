# LiveView Tetris

This is my entry in [Phoenix Phrenzy](https://phoenixphrenzy.com), showing off what [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) and [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) can do.

# Live System

A version of this system is running on gigalixir @ https://stormy-absolute-morpho.gigalixirapp.com/

## Deployment

How you deploy your app is up to you. A couple of the easiest options are:

- [Gigalixir](https://gigalixir.com/) (doesn't limit number of connections)

## The Usual README Content

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
